# Federated Sea Turtle Re-Identification under Semi-Disjoint Identities

Overview:

Traditional identification methods heavily rely on physical tagging. While this has been the standard practice for a long time, there has been a shift towards non-invasive methods. 
Deep Learning methods has been one of the leading methods for non-invasive animal re-identification methods, yet these centralized approaches are hindered by data privacy and communication overhead. 
Furthermore, monitoring data are inherently heterogeneous, wherein conservation sites encounter distinct environmental conditions and species distribution. While Federated Learning (FL) serves as
an alternative method to centralized training, standard FL (FedAvg) can't handle well on heterogeneous data. This study we propose a robust pipeline that integrates SOTA deep learning architectures
with specialized Federated Learning methods optimized for heterogeneous sea turtle data.
